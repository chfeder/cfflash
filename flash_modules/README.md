# Flash astrophysics simulation code modules #

These code modules are developed and maintained by Christoph Federrath (christoph.federrath@anu.edu.au).

Flash (v4.0) code modules:
- Sink particle main module (https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/pubs/sinks/sinks.html).
- Sink particle jet/outflow module (https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/pubs/outflow_model/outflow_model.html)
- Sink particle heating feedback module (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5201M/abstract)

While these sources are for Flash v4.0, they can be used for later Flash versions as well. Manual merging of the provided source files with the respective specific Flash version source files will need to be performed.
